In this tutorial, it's described how to use image recognition in ARKit, place virtual content on top of a recognized image and work with scale. Also, you will learn how to animate changes of the heading and position based on the image's transform with lerp. Principal difference with ARKit 2.0 image tracking is that you can still use plane detection.
